Fayez Lahoud, Sabine SÃ¼sstrunk

Given a set of pre-aligned images, our algorithm geneates a high quality fusion reflecting the relevant features from all the inputs, independant of network architecture and depth. Our method can be applied to different fusion tasks (thermal, medical, focus, exposure, etc.), and accepts any numbre of source images.
